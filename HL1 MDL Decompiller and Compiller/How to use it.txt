You've probably noticed that some player models are made up of two parts.

1) model name.mdl
2) the model nameT.mdl

They should be together in one folder.

If, for example, there is a zombie class on the server, the model of which consists of 2 parts, but only the model without the T model is placed, then when someone enters the server it will be discarded due to the lack of the T model.

How to remove T.mdl?


1. Place the model and T model in the HL1 MDL Compiler & Decompiler folder
2. Decompile the model without T using mdldec12
3. Remove *.mdl and *T.mdl from the folder
4. Find the file with the extension *.qc
5. Open it with any text editor, and delete $ externaltextures
6. Save the *.qc file after editing
7. Paste the *.qc file into compiler.bat, then press Enter
8. It remains to wait a bit, and the model without *T.mdl appears in the folder

If *T.mdl cannot be removed on some models
Then this plugin can be used:
/////////////////////
#include <amxmodx>
 
#define PLUGIN "Tmodel"
#define VERSION "1.0"
#define AUTHOR "modelT"
 
public plugin_init () {
register_plugin (PLUGIN, VERSION, AUTHOR)
}

public plugin_precache ()
{
precache_model ("models / player / model / modelT.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model2 / model2T.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model3 / model3T.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model4 / model4T.mdl")
}

/////////////////////
instead

precache_model ("models / player / model / modelT.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model2 / model2T.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model3 / model3T.mdl")
precache_model ("models / player / model4 / model4T.mdl")


We write the path to our models.
