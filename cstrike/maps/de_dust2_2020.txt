Dust II 2020 - Bomb/Defuse
by Daniil Lebedev (artstation.com/seedee)

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent extremists from
bombing crates of ancient artifacts. Team
members must defuse any bombs that threaten
targeted areas.

Terrorists: The culture of the idol worshippers
is spreading like a plague. We must wipe out
their heritage once and for all.

Other Notes: There are 2 historical artifact
stashes in the mission.
