October 31st. Evian (France), somewhere in a pedestrian street...

Terrorists like Halloween : they can disguise themselves, scare others, watch horror movies and play horror games while eating a lot of candies...
And that's the point : tonight, nobody give them candies !! They're angry and take 4 guys hostage. They will release them only against candies.
But Counter-Terrorists will not give them their candy so easily. However, they don't have the choice, they must deploy the GIGN to stop them and save the hostages !!



Terrorists : 
Kill Counter-Terrorists

Counter-Terrorists :
