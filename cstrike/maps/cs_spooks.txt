Welcome foolish mortals…

CTs:  Enter the mansion, find the 
guests (the ones that are mortal), 
and bring them back to the main 
gates (the CT spawn).

Ts: Prevent the CTs from rescuing 
your soon-to-be eternal residents 
of the haunted mansion.

NOTES:
- The buggy can only be ridden by 
two people at once.  
- The haunts have set a few traps 
here and there, so watch your step.
