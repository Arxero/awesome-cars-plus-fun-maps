SHAHMAT- Fight Yard
map by ZPhugeFan

Info:
This is an actual chess board where you can play
actual chess!! CTs control the white pieces and Ts
control the black. Set the map's round time to infinite
and the map's overall time limit to infinite and 
you're ready to play a game of chess in Counter-Strike!
How crazy is that?!

Notes:
Shoot the gong to declare end of your turn. Use TV screens
to look at the board. Use the button on the side
when you need to promote a pawn or need a spare piece.
