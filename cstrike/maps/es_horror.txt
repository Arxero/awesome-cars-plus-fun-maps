It's a small abandoned village with only four houses.
Beyond the village and a small river
there is a great fortress, also abandoned...!
But there is still something... the devil ??



--==-- Terrorists --==--

The terrorists start at the attic and in a few other rooms. They have to escape to
the small village. Around the fortress there are a few strong weapons.
That's the only way to bypass the Counter-Terrorists.
The escape point is near the exit of the village,
find it and be very careful!



--==-- Counter-Terrorists --==--

Prevent all terrorists from escaping and
neutralize all escaped terrorists.
Buy some weapons to stop the terrorists!
And be careful, too...
